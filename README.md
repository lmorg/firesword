# Firesword

An apachetop-style project + log parsing. Provides CLI piping, ncurses and SQL queries.

There's still a few bugs to be fixed and features I'm planning to add, but it's already a fairly stable project and very much usable.

_About nurses support:_

Ncurses can be enabled or disabled via '`// +build ignore`' at the top of ncurses.go

Ncurses mode also requires sqlite and readline, so compiling with ncurses breaks cross-compiling portability (which is why I disable it by default)

### Required imports:

    go get github.com/lmorg/apachelogs    # my apache log parsing package
    go get github.com/ActiveState/tail    # tail -f like library

_Additionally required for ncurses support:_

    go get github.com/nsf/termbox-go      # pretty terminal APIs
    go get github.com/shavac/readline     # readline.c support for inputting SQL
    go get github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3    # sqlite engine

	Usage: firesword -n [-r int] [-t int]     -f str | *
	                 [--fmt str] [--grep str] --stdin | -f str | *
	                 -h | -hf | -hg | -v

	Global preferences:
	-------------------
	  --no-smp       Disable multi-processor support (SMP enabled by default)
	  --no-errors    Surpress error messages, don't fail on unless fatal

	Ncurses interface:
	------------------
	  -n             Start ncurses mode. The real time user interface
	  -r int         Refresh rate in seconds (default is 1 second)
	  --sql str      SQL to start with (default is "SELECT * FROM default_view")

	Command line interface:
	-----------------------
	  --fmt str      Output format (default: "{ip} {uri} {status} {stitle}")
	                     (-hf for field names and how to declare field lengths)
	  --grep str     Filter results (-hg for patterns)

	Input streams:
	--------------
	  --stdin        Read from STDIN (not available in ncurses mode)
	  -f str         Read from text stream, equivalent to tail -f (file name as string)
	  *              Read from text / gzip file (multiple files space delimited)

	Help:
	-----
	  -h | -?        Prints this usage guide
	  -hf            Prints format field names
	  -hg            Prints grep pattern guide
	  -v             Prints version number

	Field names:
	------------
	  date        Date of request
	  datetime    Date and time of request (not available to --fmt, use "{date} {time}")
	  epoch       EPOCH (UNIX) timestamp (not yet available to --grep)
	  file        File name of log
	  ip          IP address
	  method      HTTP method (eg GET, POST, HEAD, etc)
	  proc        Processing time
	  proto       Protocol (eg HTTP, HTTPS)
	  qs          Query string
	  ref         Referrer
	  sdesc       HTTP status description (not available to --grep)
	  size        HTTP response body size
	  status      HTTP status (--grep as string)
	  stitle      HTTP status title (not available to --grep)
	  time        Time of request
	  ua          User agent
	  uid         User ID (if applicable)
	  uri         URI

	--fmt field lengths are comma-separated printf-style values. eg
	  "{ref,-30}" == Referrer,  30 characters padding, left justified
	  "{file,40}" == File name, 40 characters padding, right justified


### firesward -hg

	The following is the grep format (braces for illustration purposes only):
	--grep '(field name)(operator)(comparison);(field name)(operator)(comparison);'
	eg: firesword --grep 'time>12:00'
	    firesword --grep 'status=500;time<14:35'
	    
	Operators:
	----------
	  <   less than                         (date and numeric fields only)
	  >   greater than                      (date and numeric fields only)
	  ==  equals (= is also valid)
	  !=  does not equal (<> is also valid)
	  =+  contains                          (string fields only)
	  !+  does not contain                  (string fields only)
	  =~  regex matches                     (string fields only)
	  !~  regex does not match              (string fields only)
	  ~<  round field down to the nearest n (numeric fields only)
	  ~>  round field up to the nearest n   (numeric fields only)
	  {}  regex substitution: {search}{replace} (string fields only)
	  /   divide                            (numeric fields only)
	  *   multiply                          (numeric fields only)

	Date / Time Formats:
	--------------------
	  date: dd-mm-yyyy
	  time: hh:mm
	(Date and time fields are entered as strings but processed as numeric fields)
