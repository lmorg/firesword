# Firesword

An apachetop-style project + log parsing. Provides CLI piping, ncurses and SQL queries.

There's still a few bugs to be fixed and features I'm planning to add, but it's already a fairly stable project and very much usable.

_About nurses support:_

Ncurses can be enabled or disabled via '`// +build ignore`' at the top of ncurses.go

Ncurses mode also requires sqlite and readline, so compiling with ncurses breaks cross-compiling portability (which is why I disable it by default)

### Required imports:

    go get github.com/lmorg/apachelogs    # my apache log parsing package
    go get github.com/ActiveState/tail    # tail -f like library

_Additionally required for sqlite support:_

    go get github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3    # sqlite engine


### firesward -h

	Usage: firesword -n [-r int] [-t int]     -f str | *
	                 [--fmt str] [--grep str] --stdin | -f str | *
	                 -h | -hf | -hg | -v

	Global preferences:
	-------------------
	  --no-errors    Surpress error messages, don't fail on unless fatal

	Command line interface:
	-----------------------
	  --fmt str      Output format (default: "{ip} {uri} {status} {stitle}")
	                     (-hf for field names and how to declare field lengths)
	  --grep str     Filter results (-hg for patterns)
	  --trim-slash   Trims trailing slash from URI (useful for "sort | uniq -c")

	Input streams:
	--------------
	  --stdin        Read from STDIN
	  -f str         Read from text stream, equivalent to tail -f (file name as string)
	  *              Read from text / gzip file (multiple files space delimited)

	Help:

	  -h | -?        Prints this usage guide
	  -hf            Prints format field names
	  -hg            Prints grep pattern guide

	  ip             IP address
	  method         HTTP method (eg GET, POST, HEAD, etc)
	  proc           Processing time
	  proto          Protocol (eg HTTP, HTTPS)
	  qs             Query string

	  uid            User ID (if applicable)
	  uri            URI

	--fmt field lengths are comma-separated printf-style values. eg
	  "{ref,-30}" == Referrer,  30 characters padding, left justified
	  "{file,40}" == File name, 40 characters padding, right justified


### firesward -hg

	The following is the grep format (braces for illustration purposes only):
	--grep '(field name)(operator)(comparison);(field name)(operator)(comparison);'
	eg: firesword --grep 'time>12:00'
	    firesword --grep 'status=500;time<14:35'
	    firesword --grep 'uri{}{foo}{bar}'

	Operators:
	----------
	  <   less than                             (date and numeric fields only)
	  >   greater than                          (date and numeric fields only)
	  ==  equals (= is also valid)              (all fields)
	  !=  does not equal (<> is also valid)     (all fields)
	  =+  contains                              (string fields only)
	  !+  does not contain                      (string fields only)
	  =~  regex matches                         (string fields only)
	  !~  regex does not match                  (string fields only)
	  ~<  round field down to the nearest n     (numeric fields only)
	  ~>  round field up to the nearest n       (numeric fields only)
	  {}  regex substitution: {search}{replace} (string fields only)
	  /   divide                                (numeric fields only)
	  *   multiply                              (numeric fields only)
